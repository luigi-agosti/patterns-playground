/**
 * Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
 * Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring
 * to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction 
 * independently.
 * 
 * Define an interface for communicating with colleague objects.
 * 
 * Mediator ois different form Facade :
 *  - facade provides a simple interface to interact with a complex object
 *    but it is unidirectional.
 *  - mediator provides a way for object to collaborate, it is
 *    multidirectional.
